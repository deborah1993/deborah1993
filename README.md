Heyyy there 😄! My name is name + lastname & I'm a FullStack Web Developer 💻!

A little bit about me... 📢 I finished High School not knowing what I wanted to be. But I was sure about one thing: I wanted to get a job that allows me to travel the world and be able to work from everywhere! I was in love with the idea of being a "digital nomad" but didn't know how to become one. At my 28 years old, a very important person in my life encourage me to study web development and today I can say it was one of the best decisions I've ever made! It was a before and after in my life!! I love the IT world, keep learning day-by-day and challenging myself. 

This are some of the technologies that I have been using so far: 

✔️ HTML - CSS - JavaScript

✔️ React Js - Redux

✔️ Node Js - Express

✔️ Sequelize - PostgresSQL

✔️ Git - Github
